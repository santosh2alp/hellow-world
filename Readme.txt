The Data types in python are:
boolean:Valid values:true,false Default value:false Size:1 bit 
isEnabled = True
byte:
b'python'
list:
listOfFruits = ["apples","mangoes","bananas"]
tuple:
listOfVegetables = ("carrot","brinjal","cauliflower")
dict:
numberDictonary = {"one":1,"Two":2}
Complex Number:
z = 2+3j
float:
x=2.3
long:
bigValue = 1094324242344L
string:
y = "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog"
